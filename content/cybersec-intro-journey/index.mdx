# From Risk Management to Cybersecurity: My Journey into SOC & GRC

For over a decade, I built experience in **credit risk management, financial analysis, and internal controls**. While these fields gave me a strong foundation in evaluating risk and designing safeguards, I began to realize that the challenges shaping the future were increasingly digital. That realization sparked my transition into the world of **cybersecurity**.

---

## Why Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity appealed to me for two main reasons:

1. **Relevance** â€“ Every organization today depends on digital infrastructure, and the risk landscape is constantly evolving.
2. **Transferable skills** â€“ My background in financial risk and compliance gave me a natural bridge into governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) within security. At the same time, I wanted to expand my technical skill set to include **security operations (SOC)**.

---

## First Steps: Building the Foundation

To kick off this career pivot, I earned **CompTIA Security+**, which provided a structured way to cover the fundamentals:

- Threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities
- Security operations and incident response
- Risk management and compliance frameworks

Passing Security+ gave me confidence that my existing risk management background could integrate with newly acquired security knowledge.

## Expanding the Path: SOC & GRC Together

Instead of choosing only one track, I decided to pursue a **dual path**:

- **SOC (Security Operations Center)**

  - Hands-on labs with **Wireshark** and **Nmap**
  - Building detection and triage workflows with **Splunk**
  - Enrolled in **TryHackMeâ€™s Security Analyst Level 1 (SAL1)** learning path

- **GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance)**
  - Training on **ISO/IEC 27001 Foundations**
  - Creating a starter **risk register** and mapping controls
  - Enrolling in **MITâ€™s Cybersecurity for Managers** program (Fall 2025)

This way, Iâ€™m building both the **technical detection and response skills** and the **framework knowledge** organizations look for.

---

## Portfolio Projects

To make the transition tangible, Iâ€™m working on a set of **portfolio projects** that anyone can follow along with:

- **SOC Lab Reports** â†’ documenting investigations from TryHackMe labs
- **SIEM Log Analysis Report** â†’ using Splunk to simulate incident detection
- **Incident Escalation Playbook** â†’ simple workflows for alert triage
- **Vulnerability Scan Report** â†’ scanning with OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials
- **ISO 27001 Risk Register** â†’ mapping risks and controls for a mock environment

These projects not only help me learn, but also show potential employers that I can bridge **governance and operations**.

---

## Looking Ahead

My goal is to secure a role as a **SOC Analyst** or **GRC Analyst** by **Springâ€“Summer 2026**. Until then, Iâ€™ll continue sharing:

- Study roadmaps for certifications (ISC2 CC, ISO 27001, etc.)
- Lab walkthroughs and lessons learned
- Templates and resources for others making the same journey

---

## Final Thoughts

Transitioning into cybersecurity isnâ€™t easy â€” but with a structured plan, transferable skills, and a willingness to learn hands-on, itâ€™s absolutely possible.

Iâ€™ll keep sharing my progress here, and I hope my notes and projects can help others considering a similar leap.

ðŸ‘‰ Stay tuned for upcoming posts where Iâ€™ll break down **SOC labs, SIEM reports, and ISO 27001 controls** in more detail.
