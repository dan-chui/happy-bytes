Let's do a quick breakdown of **Variables** and **Identifiers**, which are essential for writing JavaScript code.

JavaScript is a Dynamic Type language: variables have no types, and can change typing. Additionally, variables are checked during run-time (the execution stage).

## Variables

Variables are basically containers for storing data, and can be declared in 4 ways:

1.  Automatically
2.  Using <code>let</code>
3.  Using <code>const</code>
4.  Using <code>var</code>

These variables carry rules that a JavaScript writer should remember:

1. Always declare variables
2. Always use <code>const</code> if the VALUE should not be changed
3. Always use <code>const</code> if the TYPE should not be changed (for Arrays and Objects)
4. Only use <code>let</code> if you cannot use <code>const</code>
5. Only use <code>var</code> if you need to support older browsers

## Identifiers

> All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called Identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, distance, totalWeight).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
2. Names must begin with a letter.
3. Names can also begin with $ and \_
4. Names are case sensitive (a and A are different variables).
5. Reserved words (such as JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
