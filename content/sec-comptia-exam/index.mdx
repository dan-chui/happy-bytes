# My Journey to Passing the CompTIA Security+ Exam

When I first decided to shift my career path toward **cybersecurity**, I knew the CompTIA **Security+ (SY0-701)** exam would be an important milestone. It’s one of the most widely recognized entry-level certifications, and for me, it served as both a **confidence boost** and a **structured way to cover the fundamentals**.

## Study Approach

I built my study plan around a mix of resources:

- The official CompTIA Security+ study guide
- Practice exams (lots of them!)
- Online courses and video lessons
- Hands-on labs to reinforce key concepts

Balancing theory with practice was critical. I found that breaking down the objectives into smaller topics—networking, cryptography, compliance, risk management—made the content much less overwhelming.

## Challenges Along the Way

The hardest part wasn’t necessarily the technical content but **staying consistent**. Like many people making a career pivot, I had to fit study time around work and life. Setting realistic goals (like 1–2 hours a day, 5–6 days a week) helped me keep moving forward without burning out.

## Passing the Exam

On exam day, I was nervous but prepared. The performance-based questions tested more than just memorization—they required understanding how to apply concepts in real scenarios. Walking out with a high score was incredibly rewarding.

Security+ didn’t just give me a credential—it gave me the **foundation and confidence** to keep going deeper into cybersecurity.

## What’s Next?

This certification is just one step. I’m now focusing on building practical projects, exploring GRC, and working through additional certifications like ISO 27001 and (ISC)² CC.

If you’re on a similar journey, my advice is simple: **be consistent, use multiple resources, and don’t be afraid to get hands-on.**
