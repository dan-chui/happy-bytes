We will simplify 2 challenging advanced JavaScript topics: **Scopes** & **Type Coercion**.

## Scopes

> Scoping: How a program's variables are organized and accessed.

> Lexical environment: the scope or environment the engine is currently reading code in.

A new lexical environment is created when curly brackets {} are used, even nested brackets `{{...}}` create a new lexical environment.

The execution context tells the engine which lexical environment it is currently working in and the lexical scope determines the available variables.

> Scope: The environment in which a certain variable is declared. There is a _Global_ scope, _Function_ scope, and _Block_ scope.

_Global_ scope:

1. Available outside of _any_ function or block.
2. Variables declared in _Global_ scope are accessible everywhere.

```js
const name = 'Dan';
const human = true;
```

_Function_ scope:

1. Variables are accessible _*only inside*_ a function or block, _NOT_ outside.
2. It is also called _Local_ scope.

```js
function localScope() {
  const localVariable = 'Local';
  console.log(localVariable); // Accesses localVariable
}

localScope(); // Output: "Local"
console.log(localVariable); // Output: ReferenceError
```

_Block_ scope:

1. Variables are accessible _only inside a block_.
2. #1 only applies to `let` and `const` variables.
3. Functions are also block scoped (only in Strict mode)

```js
function localScope() {
  const localVariable = 'Local';
  console.log(localVariable);
}

localScope(); // Output: "Local"
console.log(localVariable); // Output: ReferenceError
```

> Scope of a variable: The region of a code where a certain variable can be accessed.

## Type Coercion

Type coercion is the process of converting one type of value into another. There are 3 types of conversion in JavaScript:

1. to `string`
2. to `boolean`
3. to `number`

```js
let string = '1';
let number = 1;
number == string; // Output: true

// == is loose equality, === is strict equality
// double equals (==) will perform a type conversion
// one or both sides may undergo conversions
// in this case, 1 == 1 or '1' == '1' before checking equality
```

_Strict equals_: The triple equals (===) or strict equality compares two values without type coercion. If the values are not the same type, then the values are not equal.

```js
let string = '1';
let number = 1;
number === string; // Output: false
```
