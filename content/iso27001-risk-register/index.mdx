Understanding risk is one of the core skills in cybersecurity.

ISO/IEC 27001 provides a formal framework for assessing, prioritizing, and treating risks - but the real value comes from _practicing_ how these concepts work in context.

After passing the JLPT N2 earlier this year, I began my cybersecurity journey with a focus on foundations. One of the most meaningful exercises from my ISO 27001 studies was building a **Risk Register** from scratch.

## 🌐 What Is a Risk Register?

A Risk Register is a structured document used to:

- Identify assets and threats
- Estimate likelihood and impact
- Map risks to existing or needed controls
- Prioritize treatment actions
- Track progress over time

It turns abstract standards into an actionable view of _what actually matters_ to an organization.

## 🛠️ How I Built My Example Register

To internalize the concepts, I created a simplified scenario and applied the ISO 27001 methodology:

1. **Defined Assets** - endpoints, credentials, cloud services, and internal data
2. **Identified Threats & Vulnerabilities** - unauthorized access, misconfiguration, weak passwords, data exposure
3. **Evaluated Risk Levels** - using a simple 1-5 likelihood/impact scale
4. **Mapped Applicable Controls** - referencing Annex A (e.g., A.5.1, A.8.3, A.8.16)
5. **Assigned Treatment Options** - mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept
6. **Noted Residual Risk** - what remains after controls are applied

This helped me practice “thinking like a risk analyst” - understanding how security decisions flow from visibility, context, and prioritization.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

Working through this exercise deepened my understanding of:

- How risks interact with business context
- Why control selection must be purposeful
- The balance between likelihood and impact
- The importance of clear communication in security management

Security, much like photography, relies on perspective.

The more sharply we see details - and the more clearly we frame them - the better we can understand the whole picture.
