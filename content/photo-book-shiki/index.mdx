In cybersecurity, we talk often about vigilance, precision, and timing — qualities that also exist in the creative process.

Over the past year, I’ve been balancing my professional growth in cybersecurity with a long-term personal project:

**四季 Shiki: Four Seasons of Japan** — a fine-art photo book that captures the subtle transitions of light and season across Tokyo and beyond.

Creating _Shiki_ became a meditation on observation — learning to notice what changes quietly, what remains still, and how cycles repeat in their own rhythm. The same patience required to analyze a log or trace an incident is needed to wait for the right light, or the passing of a cloud.

The project reminded me that stillness and awareness are not opposites of action — they make it possible. Whether in art or in security, balance comes from attention.
