# Lessons from MIT: Cybersecurity for Managers – A Playbook

---

Completing the **MIT Cybersecurity for Managers: A Playbook** program through the **MIT Sloan School of Management** was a defining experience in my cybersecurity journey.

The course reframed how I see cybersecurity — not merely as a technical barrier, but as a **strategic business capability** that underpins trust and continuity.

---

## From Awareness to Accountability

What resonated most was MIT’s emphasis that _technology alone cannot protect an organization_.  
Culture, communication, and leadership form the first line of defense.

In an **English conversation school** context, where data privacy, scheduling, and digital payments are vital, this means every teacher and administrator plays a role. Training staff to identify phishing attempts or protect sensitive data is not just an IT task — it’s a shift in mindset and responsibility.

The recent cyberattacks on Japanese companies such as **Askul** and **Asahi** underscore that no organization is immune. Japan, as a whole, has room to grow in fostering stronger cybersecurity awareness and operational resilience.

## Key Takeaways

- **Cybersecurity is strategic** — a leadership responsibility.
- **Culture drives security** — awareness must start from the top.
- **Risk-based decision-making** aligns protection with business value.
- **Incident response plans** should be practiced, not just documented.
- **Education empowers resilience** — everyone has a role in security.

## Applying the Playbook

After completing the course, I began drafting a simple **cybersecurity playbook** tailored for small educational organizations. It starts with mapping data flows, clarifying access rights, and defining clear escalation procedures. Alongside these policies, I will propose implementing regular awareness sessions, strengthening authentication practices, and aligning our approach with **ISO 27001** principles.

The goal is not compliance for its own sake — but to build a **culture of trust and preparedness**.

## Continuing the Journey

This MIT program complements my existing certifications — **CompTIA Security+**, **(ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)**, and **ISO/IEC 27001 Foundations** — and supports my upcoming hands-on studies with **Splunk Core Certified User** and **TryHackMe Security Analyst Level 1**.

Together, these experiences are shaping my next chapter as I transition toward **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** and **Security Operations Center (SOC)** roles.

MIT reinforced one powerful truth: cybersecurity leadership is about guiding teams, setting priorities, and ensuring that **security becomes part of how we work every day**.
