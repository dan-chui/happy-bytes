## 🔄 How I Use These Resources

I typically split my reading into:

- **Weekly deep dives:** one or two long-form articles or reports
- **Project-driven research:** focused reading tied to labs or certifications

This helps balance awareness with depth without becoming overwhelming.

## 📌 Final Notes

This list will continue to grow as I progress through **SOC labs**, **GRC frameworks**, and **certifications**.

If you’re starting out in cybersecurity, consistency matters more than volume - pick a few trusted sources and build a habit.
