Let's identify and review examples of different Event Handling features available within JavaScript.

## Event Handling

_**addEventListener**_

This is the preferred method for attaching event handlers. It allows multiple event listeners and avoids overwriting existing handlers.

```js
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  console.log('Button was clicked!');
});
```

---

_**onclick**_

Assigns a function directly to the onclick
property of an element. Be careful, as it can
overwrite existing click handlers.

```js
button.onclick = () => {
  console.log('Button was clicked!');
};
```

---

_**onmouseover/onmouseout**_

Handles mouseover and mouseout events,
respectively.

```js
element.onmouseover = () => {
  element.style.background = 'white';
};

element.onmouseout = () => {
  element.style.background = 'black';
};
```

---

_**onkeydown/onkeyup**_

Manages keydown (detects when a key is pressed) and keyup (detects when a key is released) events, respectively.

```js
input.onkeydown = (event) => {
  if (event.key === 'Enter') {
    console.log('Enter key was pressed!');
  }
};

input.onkeyup = (event) => {
  if (event.key === 'Enter') {
    console.log('Enter key was released!');
  }
};
```

---

_**onsubmit**_

Handles the submit event of a Form element. It is good practice to use `preventDefault()` because it tells the user agent that if the event does not get explicitly handled, its default action should not be taken.

```js
form.onsubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log('Form was submitted!');
};
```

---

_**onchange**_

Responds to changes in the value of an Input element.

```js
input.onchange = () => {
  console.log('Input value was changed!');
};
```

---

_**onload**_

Handles the load event of a window or an image element.

```js
window.onload = () => {
  console.log('Window loaded!');
};
```
