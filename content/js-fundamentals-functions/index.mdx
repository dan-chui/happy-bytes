Let's look at a brief overview of **6 Function types**:

## Functions

_**Named Functions**_ - The traditional method.

```js
function myFunction() {
  console.log('Hello World!');
}

myFunction();
```

---

_**Anonymous Functions**_ - Functions without a name, are used as function expressions or for arguments.

```js
let greeting = function (name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
};

greeting('Dan');
// Output: Hello Dan
```

---

_**Arrow Functions**_ - Introduced in the ES6 JS update, allows shorter syntax and one-line functions.

```js
let greeting = () => console.log('Hello');

greeting();
// Output: Hello
```

---

_**IIFE Functions**_ - Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE), are immediately executed after being called. IIFE are used to create private scopes, and to avoid polluting the global namespace.

```js
(function () {
  let string = 'Hi there!';
  console.log(string);
})();
// Immediately Invoked Output: Hi there!
```

---

_**Higher Order Functions**_ - Functions that take one or more functions as arguments, or returns a function. Example: map(), filter(), reduce()

```js
let array = [5, 10, 15];

let newArray = array.map((element) => element + 10);
console.log(newArray);
// Output: [25, 30, 35]
```

---

_**Constructor Functions**_ - These are used as templates/blueprints for creating objects with similar properties and methods. They are invoked using the _new_ keyword to create instances of objects.

```js
function Person(name, country) {
  this.name = name;
  this.country = country;
}

let user1 = new Person('Dan', 'Japan');

console.log(
  `Hello there! I'm ${user1.name}, and I'm located in ${user1.country}!`
);
// Output: Hello there! I'm Dan, and I'm located in Japan!
```
