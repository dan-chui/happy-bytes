Let's examine a brief overview of Data Types.

## Data Types

**There are 7 Primitive Data Types**

_**Number**_: Floating point numbers. Used for decimals and integers

```js
let age = 28;
```

---

_**String**_: A sequence of characters. Used for text.

```js
let firstName = 'Dan';
```

---

_**Boolean**_: A logical type that is either _true_ OR _false_. Used for making decisions.

```js
let fullName = true;
```

---

_**Undefined**_: An ('empty value') that is taken by a variable and not yet defined.

```js
let happy;
```

---

_**Null**_: An 'empty value'.

```js
let a = null;
console.log(a);
//Output:
null;
```

---

_**Symbol**_: A value that is unique and cannot be changed.

```js
let sym = Symbol.for('happy');
```

---

_**BigInt**_: Much larger integers than what the Number type can hold.

```js
let bigInt = 1n;
```
